# ArchHacks2017


At ArchHacks 2017 we were given the mandate to create a Hack that was directly related to something in the health industry. We decided to tackle one of the biggest problems in the United States and around the world, Diabetes.

It was our goal to create a website that would ensure any visitor left with a complete understanding of what diabetes is, the differences between Type 1 and Type 2, and also what can be done in terms of lifestyle and habit changes that could prevent the onset of diabetes in the future.

The site also consolidates information from the leading Research Centers and Companies focused on diabetes into one place where you can read more about each organization and visit their platforms to see what advancement's they are making towards the alleviation and prospective eradication of diabetes.
